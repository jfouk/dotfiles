* Notes Structure
** Directory Structure
  - Root
      - Journal :: Daily logs and todos are stored here
            - contains a TODAY symlink to link to the current day
      - Projects :: Specific project files from the daily log are copied here
      - Education :: Store things I learn here
** Process
      - Each day, write in the current journal entry
      - if there is something I write down in the current journal entry that
        I want to move to a different structure, add a tag thats either
        /:help:/ or /:project:/
      - At the end of the day, go through all /:help:/ or /:project:/ tags and
        copy them over to a new directory
